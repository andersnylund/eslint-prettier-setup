# Easy setup of eslint and prettier configured to follow AirBnb style guide

To install run `./setup.sh`

Wanted to create a simple script to do it for me, so I wouldn't need to search [this](https://blog.echobind.com/integrating-prettier-eslint-airbnb-style-guide-in-vscode-47f07b5d7d6a) article over and over again. 

So thanks to Jeffrey Zhen!
